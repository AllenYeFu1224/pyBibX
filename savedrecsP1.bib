Abstract = {Background The gut microbiome is altered in chronic kidney disease
   (CKD), potentially contributing to CKD progression and co-morbidities,
   but population-based studies of the gut microbiome across a wide range
   of kidney function and damage are lacking. Methods In the Hispanic
   Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, gut microbiome was assessed by
   shotgun sequencing of stool (n = 2,438; 292 with suspected CKD). We
   examined cross-sectional associations of estimated glomerular filtration
   rate (eGFR), urinary albumin:creatinine (UAC) ratio, and CKD with gut
   microbiome features. Kidney trait-related microbiome features were
   interrogated for correlation with serum metabolites (n = 700), and
   associations of microbiome-related serum metabolites with kidney trait
   progression were examined in a prospective analysis (n = 3,635). Results
   Higher eGFR was associated with overall gut microbiome composition,
   greater abundance of species from Prevotella, Faecalibacterium,
   Roseburia, and Eubacterium, and microbial functions related to synthesis
   of long-chain fatty acids and carbamoyl-phosphate. Higher UAC ratio and
   CKD were related to lower gut microbiome diversity and altered overall
   microbiome composition only in participants without diabetes. Microbiome
   features related to better kidney health were associated with many serum
   metabolites (e.g., higher indolepropionate, beta-cryptoxanthin; lower
   imidazole propionate, deoxycholic acids, p-cresol glucuronide).
   Imidazole propionate, deoxycholic acid metabolites, and p-cresol
   glucuronide were associated with prospective reductions in eGFR and/or
   increases in UAC ratio over similar to 6 y. Conclusions Kidney function
   is a significant correlate of the gut microbiome, while the relationship
   of kidney damage with the gut microbiome depends on diabetes status. Gut
   microbiome metabolites may contribute to CKD progression.},

Abstract = {BackgroundTo assess demographics and outcomes up to 3 years of age among
   children with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in California neonatal
   intensive care units (NICUs) during 2010-2021. MethodsThe California
   Perinatal Quality Care Collaborative (CPQCC) collects data on all very
   low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight <= 1500 g) and acutely ill infants
   with birth weight > 1500 g across 92\% of NICUs in California. VLBW
   infants and those with neurological conditions are referred to a
   statewide high-risk infant follow-up (HRIF) program. CMV infection was
   defined as a positive culture or PCR identified during the NICU
   hospitalization. ResultsDuring 2010-2021, CMV reporting rates averaged
   3.5/1000 VLBW infants (n = 205) and 1.1/1000 infants >1500 g (n = 128).
   Among all 333 infants with CMV, 314 (94\%) were discharged home alive,
   271 (86\%) were referred for HRIF and 205 (65\%) had >= 1 visit. Whereas
   infants born to mothers <20 years of age had highest CMV reporting rates
   and those born to Hispanic mothers comprised 49\% of all infected
   infants, they had the highest loss of follow-up. At the 12-month visit
   (n = 152), 19 (13\%) infants with CMV had bilateral blindness and 18
   (12\%) had hearing loss. At the 24-month visit, 5 (5\%) of 103 had
   severe cerebral palsy. ConclusionsAmong infants admitted to the NICU,
   those with CMV diagnoses may over represent infants with more severe CMV
   disease and outcomes. The CPQCC and HRIF program findings may help
   inform implementation of surveillance for congenital CMV infection in
   other U.S. states and guide strategies to reduce disparities in access
   to services.},

Abstract = {Study Design. Retrospective analysis on prospectively collected
   data.Objective. The purposes of this study were to (1) assess
   disparities in relative utilization of outpatient cervical spine surgery
   between White and Black patients from 2010 to 2019 and (2) to measure
   how these racial differences have evolved over time.Summary of
   Background Data. Although outpatient spine surgery has become
   increasingly popularized over the last decade, it remains unknown how
   racial disparities in surgical utilization have translated to the
   outpatient setting and whether restrictive patterns of access to
   outpatient cervical spine procedures may exist.Methods. A retrospective
   cohort study from 2010 to 2019 was conducted using the National Surgical
   Quality Improvement Program database. Relative utilization of outpatient
   (same-day discharge) for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion
   (OP-ACDF) and cervical disk replacement (OP-CDR) were assessed and
   trended over time between races. Multivariable regressions were
   subsequently utilized to adjust for baseline patient factors and
   comorbidities.Results. Overall, Black patients were significantly less
   likely to undergo OP-ACDF or OP-CDR surgery when compared with White
   patients (P<0.03 for both OP-ACDF and OP-CDR). From 2010 to 2019, a
   persisting disparity over time was found in outpatient utilization for
   both ACDF and CDR (e.g. White vs. Black OP-ACDF: 6.0\% vs. 3.1\% in 2010
   compared with 16.7\% vs. 8.5\% in 2019). These results held in all
   adjusted analyses.Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first study
   reporting racial disparities in outpatient spine surgery and
   demonstrates an emerging disparity in outpatient cervical spine
   utilization among Black patients. These restrictive patterns of access
   to same-day outpatient hospital and surgery centers may contribute to
   broader disparities in the overall utilization of major spine procedures
   that have been previously reported. Renewed interventions are needed to
   both understand and address these emerging inequalities in outpatient
   care before they become more firmly established within our orthopedic
   and neurosurgery spine delivery systems.},

Abstract = {We studied the genetic associations of a previously developed
   Metabolomic Risk Score (MRS) for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and
   beta-aminoisobutyric acid metabolite (BAIBA)-the metabolite highlighted
   by results from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the MCI-MRS,
   and assessed their association with MCI in datasets of diverse
   race/ethnicities. We first performed a GWAS for the MCI-MRS and BAIBA,
   in Hispanic/Latino adults (n = 3890) from the Hispanic Community Health
   Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We identified ten independent
   genome-wide significant (p value <5 x 10(-8)) variants associated with
   MCI-MRS or BAIBA. Variants associated with the MCI-MRS are located in
   the Alanine-Glyoxylate Aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2 gene), which is known
   to be associated with BAIBA metabolism. Variants associated with BAIBA
   are located in the AGXT2 gene and in the SLC6A13 gene. Next, we tested
   the variants' association with MCI in independent datasets of n = 3178
   HCHS/SOL older individuals, n = 3775 European Americans, and n = 1032
   African Americans from the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC)
   study. Variants were considered associated with MCI if their p value
   AGXT2 region were associated with MCI. Mediation analysis supported the
   mediation effect of BAIBA between the two genetic variants and MCI (p
   value = 0.004 for causal mediated effect). In summary, genetic variants
   in the AGXT2 region are associated with MCI in Hispanic/Latino, African,
   and European American populations in the USA, and their effect is likely
   mediated by changes in BAIBA levels.},

Abstract = {Introduction Lower education is associated with higher burden of
   vascular risk factors in mid-life and higher risk of dementia in late
   life. We aim to understand the causal mechanism through which vascular
   risk factors potentially mediate the relationship between education and
   dementia.Methods In a cohort of 13,368 Black and White older adults in
   the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, we assessed the
   relationship between education (grade school, high school without
   graduation, high school graduate or equivalent, college,
   graduate/professional school) and dementia among all participants and
   among those with incident stroke. Cox models were adjusted for age,
   race-center (a variable stratified by race and field center), sex,
   apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 genotype, and family history of
   cardiovascular disease. Causal mediation models assessed mediation by
   mid-life systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, body mass
   index, and smoking.Results More education was associated with 8 to 44\%
   lower risk of dementia compared to grade school-level education in a
   dose-response pattern, while the relationship between education and
   post-stroke dementia was not statistically significant. Up to 25\% of
   the association between education and dementia was mediated through
   mid-life vascular risk factors, with a smaller percentage mediated for
   lower levels of education.Interpretation A substantial proportion of the
   relationship between education and dementia was mediated through
   mid-life vascular risk factors. However, risk factor modification is
   unlikely to fully address the large educational disparities in dementia
   risk. Prevention efforts must also address disparities in socioeconomic
   resources leading to divergent early-life education and other structural
   determinants of mid-life vascular risk factors. ANN NEUROL 2023},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Demographic factors contribute significantly to
   spine surgery out-comes. Although race and ethnicity are not proxies for
   disease states, the intersection between these patient characteristics
   and socioeconomic status significantly impact patient outcomes.PURPOSE:
   The purpose of this study is to investigate the frequency of demographic
   reporting and analysis in randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs)
   published in the three highest impact spine journals.STUDY DESIGN:
   Systematic review.PATIENT SAMPLE: We analyzed 278 randomized control
   trials published in The Spine Journal, Spine, and Journal of
   Neurosurgery: Spine between January 2012 -January 2022.OUTCOME MEASURES:
   Extracted manuscript characteristics included the frequency of
   demo-graphic reporting, sample size, and demographic composition of
   studies.METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of RCTs published
   between January 2012 - Janu-ary 2022 in the three highest impact factor
   spine journals in 2021: The Spine Journal, Spine, and Journal of
   Neurosurgery: Spine. We determined if age, gender, BMI, race, and
   ethnicity were reported and analyzed for each study. The overall
   frequency of demographic reporting was assessed, and the reporting
   trends were analyzed for each individual year and journal. Among
   stud-ies that did report demographics, the populations were analyzed in
   comparison to the national pop-ulation per United States (US) census
   reports. Studies were evaluated for bias using Cochrane risk
   -of-bias.RESULTS: Our search identified 278 RCTs for inclusion. 166 were
   published in Spine, 65 in The Spine Journal, and 47 in Journal of
   Neurosurgery: Spine. Only 9.35\% (N=26) and 3.9\% (N=11) of studies
   reported race and ethnicity, respectively. Demographic reporting
   frequency did not vary based on the publishing journal. Reporting of age
   and BMI increased over time, but reporting of race and ethnicity did
   not. Among RCTs that reported race, 88\% were conducted in the US, and
   85.71\% of the patients in these US studies were White. White subjects
   were overly represented compared to the US population (85.71\% vs.
   61.63\%, p<.001), and non-White or Black patients were most
   underrepresented (2.89\% vs. 25.96\%, p<.001).CONCLUSIONS: RCTs
   published in the three highest impact factor spine journals failed to
   fre-quently report patient race or ethnicity. Among studies published in
   the US, study populations are increasingly represented by non-Hispanic
   White patients. As we strive to care for an increasingly diverse
   population and reduce disparities to care, spine surgeons must do a
   better job reporting these variables to increase the external validity
   and generalizability of RCTs.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Age associations with tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid pharmacokinetics

Abstract = {Tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolic acid (MPA) provide maintenance
   immunosuppression and is dosed empirically in elderly kidney transplant
   recipients (KTRs) resulting in health inequities. Limited
   immunosuppressive pharmacokinetics are available comparing adult ages.
   This secondary analysis compared TAC and MPA pharmacokinetics and
   adverse effects (AEs) among young, middle-aged, and elderly Black and
   White KTRs. The 12-h TAC and MPA pharmacokinetics with AE evaluation
   were conducted in 67 stable KTRs greater than or equal to 6 months
   post-transplant. TAC regimens were adjusted to target troughs. MPA
   regimens were adjusted using clinical response. Participants were:
   young: less than or equal to 40 years; middle age: greater than 40 to 60
   years, and elderly greater than 60 years. Noncompartmental
   pharmacokinetic analysis determined area under the concentration-time
   curve 0-12h (AUC(0-12h)), clearance (CL), and CL/body mass index (BMI)
   with 0-h troughs. MPA enterohepatic recirculation (EHR),
   MPA-AUC(6-12h)/MPA-AUC(0-12h), and MPA glucuronide (MPAG)-AUC(0-12h)/
   MPA-AUC(0-12h) were determined. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   was conducted using SAS version 9.4. No group differences were noted for
   estimated glomerular filtration rate, MPA, and TAC doses. EHR was
   reduced in elderly with decreased MPA-AUC(6-12h)/MPA-AUC(0-12h) (p =
   0.049) and increased MPAG-AUC(0-12h/)MPA-AUC(0-12h) (p = 0.036). MPA
   troughs (p = 0.045) were reduced in the elderly. TAC CL/BMI (p = 0.043)
   was reduced in the elderly. For therapeutic MPA AUC(0-12h): 30-60 mg
   center dot h/L, 34.3\% KTRs achieved this target with 55.2\% greater
   than the therapeutic range. 77.6\% KTR were in the TAC AUC(0-12h)
   target: 100-190 ng center dot h/mL and 19.4\% were below this range with
   no age relationship. In 44\% young, 26\% middle-age and 7.8\% elderly
   subjects achieved target AUC(0-12)h for both medications (p = 0.036).
   Neurologic AEs were manifested in the elderly (p = 0.014).
   Immunosuppressive pharmacokinetics demonstrated age-related differences
   with reduced TAC CL/BMI and MPA EHR and increased neurologic AE in the
   elderly. This immunosuppressive regimen may require age-adjusted
   individualization to optimize allograft function.
   Study Highlights
   WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC? Tacrolimus (TAC) and
   mycophenolic acid (MPA) provide maintenance immunosuppression and are
   dosed empirically in elderly kidney transplant recipients (KTRs)
   resulting in health inequities. Limited immunosuppressive
   pharmacokinetics are available comparing adult ages. This secondary
   analysis compared TAC and MPA pharmacokinetics and adverse effects (AEs)
   among young, middle-aged, and elderly Black and White KTRs.
   WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS? This secondary analysis compared
   TAC and MPA pharmacokinetics and AEs among young, middle--aged, and
   elderly Black and White KTRs.
   WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE? This secondary analysis
   reported age--related differences in the commonly prescribed TAC and MPA
   regimen in stable KTRs. Reduced TAC Clearance/BMI and MPA enterohepatic
   recirculation and increased neurologic AEs were reported in the elderly.
   HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?
   This report suggests that TAC and MPA immunosuppressive regimen may
   require age--adjusted individualization to achieve therapeutic exposure
   and the benefits of this approach must be confirmed in a larger KTR
   population.},

Abstract = {The landmark, multicenter HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health
   Study/Study of Latinos) is the largest, most comprehensive, longitudinal
   community-based cohort study to date of diverse Hispanic/Latino persons
   in the United States. The HCHS/SOL aimed to address the dearth of
   comprehensive data on risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
   other chronic diseases in this population and has expanded considerably
   in scope since its inception. This paper describes the aims/objectives
   and data collection of the HCHS/SOL and its ancillary studies to date
   and highlights the critical and sizable contributions made by the study
   to understanding the prevalence of and changes in CVD risk/protective
   factors and the burden of CVD and related chronic conditions among
   adults of diverse Hispanic/Latino backgrounds. The continued follow-up
   of this cohort will allow in-depth investigations on cardiovascular and
   pulmonary outcomes in this population, and data from the ongoing
   ancillary studies will facilitate generation of new hypotheses and study
   questions. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2023;81:1505-1520) (c) 2023 the American

Title = {Health Insurance and Initiation of Direct-Acting Antivirals for
   Hepatitis C in US Women With Human Immunodeficiency Virus},
Journal = {CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES},

Abstract = {Background Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) is well tolerated, cost-effective, and yields high sustained
   virologic response rates, yet it has remained financially inaccessible
   to many patients. Methods Participants of the Women's Interagency HIV
   Study (an observational US cohort) with human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV) and HCV (RNA+) reporting no prior hepatitis C treatment were
   followed for DAA initiation (2015-2019). We estimated risk ratios (RRs)
   of the relationship between time-varying health insurance status and DAA
   initiation, adjusting for confounders with stabilized inverse
   probability weights. We also estimated weighted cumulative incidences of
   DAA initiation by health insurance status. Results A total of 139 women
   (74\% Black) were included; at baseline, the median age was 55 years and
   86\% were insured. Most had annual household incomes <=\$18 000 (85\%);
   advanced liver fibrosis (21\%), alcohol use (45\%), and recreational
   drug use (35\%) were common. Across 439 subsequent semiannual visits, 88
   women (63\%) reported DAA initiation. Compared with no health insurance,
   health insurance increased the likelihood of reporting DAA initiation at
   a given visit (RR, 4.94; 95\% confidence limit {[}CL], 1.92 to 12.8). At
   2 years, the weighted cumulative incidence of DAA initiation was higher
   among the insured (51.2\%; 95\% CL, 43.3\% to 60.6\%) than the uninsured
   (3.5\%; 95\% CL, 0.8\% to 14.6\%). Conclusions Accounting for clinical,
   behavioral, and sociodemographic factors over time, health insurance had
   a substantial positive effect on DAA initiation. Interventions to
   increase insurance coverage should be prioritized to increase HCV
   curative therapy uptake for persons with HIV.
   Among US women with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus,
   health insurance had a substantial positive effect on the initiation of
   direct-acting antiviral therapy.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Dysregulation of sphingolipid and cholesterol metabolism
   contributes to the pathogenesis of glomerular diseases (GDs).
   Apolipoprotein M (ApoM) promotes cholesterol efflux and modulates the
   bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Glomerular ApoM
   expression is decreased in pa-tients with focal segmental
   glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). We hypothesized that glomerular ApoM
   deficiency occurs in GD and that ApoM expression and plasma ApoM
   correlate with outcomes.Methods: Patients with GD from the Nephrotic
   Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) were studied. We compared glomerular
   mRNA expression of ApoM (gApoM), sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), and S1P
   re-ceptors 1 to 5 (S1PR1-5) in patients (n = 84) and controls (n = 6).
   We used correlation analyses to determine associations between gApoM,
   baseline plasma ApoM (pApoM), and urine ApoM (uApoM/Cr). We used linear
   regression to determine whether gApoM, pApoM, and uApoM/Cr were
   associated with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
   proteinuria. Using Cox models, we determined whether gApoM, pApoM, and
   uApoM/Cr were associated with complete remission (CR) and the composite
   of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or \$40\% eGFR decline.Results: gApoM
   was reduced (P < 0.01) and SPHK1 and S1PR1 to 5 expression was increased
   (P < 0.05) in patients versus controls, consistent with ApoM/S1P pathway
   modulation. gApoM positively correlated with pApoM in the overall cohort
   (r = 0.34, P < 0.01) and in the FSGS (r = 0.48, P < 0.05) and minimal
   change disease (MCD) (r = 0.75, P< 0.05) subgroups. Every unit decrease
   in gApoM and pApoM (log2) was associated with a 9.77 ml/min per 1.73 m2
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 3.96-15.57) and 13.26 ml/min per 1.73
   m2 (95\% CI: 3.57-22.96) lower baseline eGFR, respectively (P < 0.01).
   From Cox models adjusted for age, sex, or race, pApoM was a significant
   predictor of CR (hazard ratio {[}HR]: 1.85; 95\% CI:
   1.06-3.23).Conclusions: pApoM is a potential noninvasive biomarker of
   gApoM deficiency and strongly associates with clinical outcomes in GD.},

Abstract = {Background:Hemoglobin concentration and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)
   ischemic lesions are separately known to be associated with poor
   intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) outcomes. While hemoglobin concentrations
   have known relationships with ischemic stroke, it is unclear whether
   hemoglobin concentration is associated with DWI ischemic lesions after
   ICH. We sought to investigate the hypothesis that hemoglobin
   concentrations would associate with DWI lesions after ICH and further
   investigated their relationships with clinical outcomes.
   Methods:Supratentorial ICH patients enrolled between 2010 and 2016 to a
   prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study (ERICH study
   {[}Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage]) were assessed.
   Patients from this study with baseline, admission hemoglobin, and
   hospitalization magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed. Hemoglobin was
   examined as the primary exposure variable defined as a continuous
   variable (g/dL). Magnetic resonance imaging DWI ischemic lesion presence
   was assessed as the primary radiographic outcome. Primary analyses
   assessed relationships of hemoglobin with DWI lesions. Secondary
   analyses assessed relationships of DWI lesions with poor 3-month
   outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score, 4-6). These analyses were
   performed using separate multivariable logistic regression models
   adjusting for relevant covariates. Results:Of 917 patients with ICH
   analyzed, mean baseline hemoglobin was 13.8 g/dL (+/- 1.9), 60\% were
   deep ICH, and DWI lesions were identified in 27\% of the cohort. In our
   primary analyses, increased hemoglobin, defined as a continuous
   variable, was associated with DWI lesions (adjusted odds ratio, 1.21 per
   1 g/dL change in hemoglobin {[}95\% CI, 1.07-1.37]) after adjusting for
   sex, race, ICH severity, time to magnetic resonance imaging, and acute
   blood pressure change. In secondary analyses, DWI lesions were
   associated with poor 3-month outcomes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.83 {[}95\%
   CI, 1.24-2.69]) after adjusting for similar covariates. Conclusions:We
   identified novel relationships between higher baseline hemoglobin
   concentrations and DWI ischemic lesions in patients with ICH. Further
   studies are required to clarify the role of hemoglobin concentration on
   both cerebral small vessel disease pathophysiology and ICH outcomes.},

Abstract = {Importance Higher educational attainment is associated with reduced
   dementia risk, but the role of educational quality is understudied,
   presenting a major evidence gap, especially as it may contribute to
   racial inequities.Objective To evaluate the association between
   state-level educational quality during childhood and dementia
   risk.Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study analyzed
   longitudinal data collected from January 1, 1997, through December 31,
   2019 (23-year follow-up period). The sample comprised members of Kaiser
   Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care
   delivery system, who completed an optional survey during 1964-1972.
   Eligible individuals were US born; non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic
   White; aged 65 years or older as of January 1, 1996; were still alive;
   and did not have a dementia diagnosis or lapse in KPNC membership
   greater than 90 days between January 1 and December 31, 1996.Exposures
   Historical state-level administrative indicators of school quality
   (school term length, student-teacher ratio, and attendance rates) linked
   to participants using birth state and birth year (with a 6-year lag) and
   divided into tertiles using the pooled sample.Main Outcomes and
   MeasuresDementia diagnoses from electronic health records between 1997
   and 2019 were analyzed between March 1 and August 31, 2022. The
   associations of educational quality with incident dementia were
   estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.Results Among
   21 450 KPNC members who participated in the optional survey, individuals
   born before availability of educational quality records (n = 87) and
   missing educational attainment (n = 585) were excluded. The final
   analytic sample was 20 778 individuals (56.5\% women, 43.5\% men; mean
   {[}SD] age, 74.7 {[}6.5] years; 18.8\% Black; 81.2\% White; 41.0\% with
   less than high school education). Among Black individuals, 76.2\% to
   86.1\% (vs 20.8\%-23.3\% of White individuals) attended schools in
   states in the lowest educational quality tertiles. Highest (vs lowest)
   educational quality tertiles were associated with lower dementia risk
   (student-teacher ratio: hazard ratio {[}HR], 0.88 {[}95\% CI,
   0.83-0.94]; attendance rates: HR, 0.80 {[}95\% CI, 0.73-0.88]; term
   length: HR, 0.79 {[}95\% CI, 0.73-0.86]). Effect estimates did not
   differ by race and were not attenuated by adjustment for educational
   attainment.Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, lower
   state-average educational quality was more common among Black
   individuals and associated with higher dementia risk. Differential
   investment in high-quality education due to structural racism may
   contribute to dementia disparities.},

Abstract = {Study Design.Retrospective cohort analysis. Objective.To elucidate
   trends in the utilization of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM)
   during anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures in NY
   state using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and
   to determine if utilization of IONM resulted in a reduction in
   postoperative neurological deficits. Summary of Background Data.IONM has
   been available to spinal surgeons for several decades. It has become
   increasingly prevalent in all facets of spinal surgery including
   elective ACDF procedures. The utility of IONM for preventing a
   neurological deficit in elective spine procedures has recently been
   called into question. Materials and Methods.The Statewide Planning and
   Research Cooperative System database were accessed to perform a
   retrospective cohort study comparing monitored versus unmonitored ACDF
   procedures between 2007 and 2018 as defined by the International
   Classification of Disease-9 and 10 Procedural Coding System (ICD-9 PCS,
   ICD-10 PCS) codes. Patient demographics, medical history, surgical
   intervention, pertinent in-hospital events, and urban versus rural
   medical centers (as defined by the United States Office of Management
   and Budget) were recorded. Propensity-score-matched comparisons were
   used to identify factors related to the utilization of IONM and risk
   factors for neurological deficits after elective ACDF. Results.A total
   of 70,838 {[}15,092 monitored (21.3\%) and 55,746 (78.7\%) unmonitored]
   patients' data were extracted. The utilization of IONM since 2007 has
   increased in a linear manner from 0.9\% of cases in 2007 to 36.7\% by
   2018. Overall, baseline characteristics of patients who were monitored
   during cases differed significantly from unmonitored patients in age,
   race/ethnicity, insurance type, presence of myelopathy or radiculopathy,
   and Charlson Comorbidity Index; however, only race/ethnicity was
   statistically significant when analyzed using propensity-score-matched.
   When comparing urban and rural medical centers, there is a significant
   lag in the adoption of the technology with no monitored cases in rural
   centers until 2012 with significant fluctuations in utilization compared
   with steadily increasing utilization among urban centers. From 2017 to
   2018, reporting of neurological deficits after surgery resembled
   literature-established norms. Pooled analysis of these years revealed
   that the incidence of neurological complications occurred more
   frequently in monitored cases than in unmonitored (3.0\% vs. 1.4\%, P <
   0.001). Conclusions.The utility of IONM for elective ACDF remains
   uncertain; however, it continues to gain popularity for routine cases.
   For medical centers that lack similar resources to centers in more
   densely populated regions of NY state, reliable access to this
   technology is not a certainty. In our analysis of intraoperative
   neurological complications, it seems that IONM is not protective against
   neurological injury.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a large disparity between the quality of
   neurosurgical research in developed and devel-oping nations, including
   the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Bibliometric
   analysis is an appropriate method for evaluating the quality of research
   in a geographic region. We analyzed the neurosurgery reports published
   by the ASEAN countries to highlight regional productivity in
   neurosurgery research.METHODS: We performed a bibliometric analysis of
   neurosurgery reports from the ASEAN countries between 2011 and 2020. We
   described the publication number, study type, and field of study of the
   publication articles. In addition, we assessed the correlations between
   the neurosurgery research productivity of these countries and the
   neurosurgeon ratio, medical doctor ratio, per capita gross domestic
   product, and health expenditure per capita.RESULTS: We identified 1939
   neurosurgeons in the ASEAN region; 570 articles were published by
   neurosur-geons in the region between 2011 and 2020. Singaporean
   neurosurgeons were the most productive, with 177 articles, accounting
   for 31\% of the total ASEAN neurosurgeon publications in the study
   period. However, there has been a rapid recent increase in the number of
   articles. Case re-ports and tumors were the dominant type and field of
   the articles, respectively. There was no significant correlation between
   the neurosurgical research productivity of the ASEAN countries and the
   neurosurgeon ratio, medical doctor ratio, per capita gross domestic
   product, and health expenditure per capita.CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing the
   neurosurgery publica-tions from ASEAN countries over the previous
   decade, we highlight the status of neurosurgical research in these
   countries.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the significant clinical consequences and
   socioeconomic costs of gunshot wounds to the head (GSWH), studies
   examining prehospital risk factors, geospatial patterns, and economic
   cost are lacking.
   METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for patients with GSWH
   (single or multiple injuries) presenting to the level one Ryder Trauma
   Center (hospital patients) as well as the Miami-Dade County Medical
   Examiner (ME) Department, from October 2013 to October 2015. In
   addition, ME data were queried from the previous decade (2008e2017) to
   analyze longitudinal trends.
   RESULTS: A total of 402 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria:
   297 (74\%) presented to the ME and 105 (26\%) presented to the hospital.
   GSWH in our cohort had a case fatality rate of 89\%, predominantly
   affecting males, whites, and individuals who committed suicide, with a
   mean age of 41.9 +/- 20.6 years. Hospital patients were more likely to
   be black males from low socioeconomic status (SES) regions involved in
   assault. Older white males were over-represented in patients attempting
   and completing suicide and thus comprised a higher percentage of ME
   cases. Geospatial analysis of hospital patient injury zip codes shows
   that GSWH are significantly clustered in low-income urban centers with
   greater poverty rates. In Miami-Dade County, the economic burden of
   GSWH, as measured by total health care costs and lifetime productivity
   losses, was estimated to be \$11,867,415 and \$246,179,498,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the first analysis of GSWH with the inclusion of both
   hospital and ME data in a representative urban setting, our findings
   show prehospital risk factors and the unequal distribution of the
   significant economic costs of GSWH.},

Abstract = {We aimed to characterize the existing knowledge of cerebral palsy (CP)
   prevalence globally and identify any existing publication disparities
   that may impact our understanding of the global burden of CP. To
   identify existing publications on CP prevalence, PubMed and Web of
   Science were searched in May 2021 with the following strategy:
   ``cerebral palsy{''}{[}title] AND (rate OR prevalence OR epidemiology).
   This search yielded 2720 results on PubMed and 2314 on Web of Science.
   Studies published in English, Spanish, or Japanese and which were
   available in full text were included. Studies that did not report a CP
   prevalence statistic were excluded. We identified 94 studies meeting
   inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of 94 studies, 69 (73.4\%) studies
   came from Europe, North America, and Australia with the remaining 25
   (26.6\%) from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. No studies from Latin
   America were identified. CP prevalence estimates ranged from 0.8 to 4.4
   per 1000 live births. Studies from Europe are cited more than studies
   from other regions, ranging from 7.61 citations/year since publication
   for European studies to 2.1 citations/year for Middle Eastern studies.
   Studies from Western countries are written almost exclusively by Western
   authors (99.69\%-10 0\%), while studies from Africa consist of a lower
   proportion of African authors (31.06\%). Our results highlight
   geographical disparities in our knowledge of CP epidemiology. Existing
   literature from Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are
   relatively undercited by the field. To better grasp the true impact of
   CP globally, we must support institutions and researchers in
   underrepresented regions of the world.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {An atlas of genetic scores to predict multi-omic traits},
Journal = {NATURE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 29},
Abstract = {The use of omic modalities to dissect the molecular underpinnings of
   common diseases and traits is becoming increasingly common. But
   multi-omic traits can be genetically predicted, which enables highly
   cost-effective and powerful analyses for studies that do not have
   multi-omics1. Here we examine a large cohort (the INTERVAL study2; n =
   50,000 participants) with extensive multi-omic data for plasma
   proteomics (SomaScan, n = 3,175; Olink, n = 4,822), plasma metabolomics
   (Metabolon HD4, n = 8,153), serum metabolomics (Nightingale, n = 37,359)
   and whole-blood Illumina RNA sequencing (n = 4,136), and use machine
   learning to train genetic scores for 17,227 molecular traits, including
   10,521 that reach Bonferroni-adjusted significance. We evaluate the
   performance of genetic scores through external validation across cohorts
   of individuals of European, Asian and African American ancestries. In
   addition, we show the utility of these multi-omic genetic scores by
   quantifying the genetic control of biological pathways and by generating
   a synthetic multi-omic dataset of the UK Biobank3 to identify disease
   associations using a phenome-wide scan. We highlight a series of
   biological insights with regard to genetic mechanisms in metabolism and
   canonical pathway associations with disease; for example, JAK-STAT
   signalling and coronary atherosclerosis. Finally, we develop a portal
   (https://www.omicspred.org/) to facilitate public access to all genetic
   scores and validation results, as well as to serve as a platform for
   future extensions and enhancements of multi-omic genetic scores.},

Title = {Diagnostic error among vulnerable populations presenting to the
   emergency department with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular or
   neurological symptoms: a systematic review},
Journal = {BMJ QUALITY \& SAFETY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 27},
Abstract = {Background Diagnostic error (DE) is a common problem in clinical
   practice, particularly in the emergency department (ED) setting. Among
   ED patients presenting with cardiovascular or
   cerebrovascular/neurological symptoms, a delay in diagnosis or failure
   to hospitalise may be most impactful in terms of adverse outcomes.
   Minorities and other vulnerable populations may be at higher risk of DE.
   We aimed to systematically review studies reporting the frequency and
   causes of DE in under-resourced patients presenting to the ED with
   cardiovascular or cerebrovascular/neurological symptoms.Methods We
   searched EBM Reviews, Embase, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science from
   2000 through 14 August 2022. Data were abstracted by two independent
   reviewers using a standardised form. The risk of bias (ROB) was assessed
   using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the certainty of evidence was
   evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,
   and Evaluation approach.Results Of the 7342 studies screened, we
   included 20 studies evaluating 7436,737 patients. Most studies were
   conducted in the USA, and one study was multicountry. 11 studies
   evaluated DE in patients with cerebrovascular/neurological symptoms, 8
   studies with cardiovascular symptoms and 1 study examined both types of
   symptoms. 13 studies investigated missed diagnoses and 7 studies
   explored delayed diagnoses. There was significant clinical and
   methodological variability, including heterogeneity of DE definitions
   and predictor variable definitions as well as methods of DE assessment,
   study design and reporting.Among the studies evaluating cardiovascular
   symptoms, black race was significantly associated with higher odds of DE
   in 4/6 studies evaluating missed acute myocardial infarction (AMI)/acute
   coronary syndrome (ACS) diagnosis compared with white race (OR from 1.18
   (1.12-1.24) to 4.5 (1.8-11.8)). The association between other analysed
   factors (ethnicity, insurance and limited English proficiency) and DE in
   this domain varied from study to study and was inconclusive.Among the
   studies evaluating DE in patients with cerebrovascular/neurological
   symptoms, no consistent association was found indicating higher or lower
   odds of DE. Although some studies showed significant differences, these
   were not consistently in the same direction.The overall ROB was low for
   most included studies; however, the certainty of evidence was very low,
   mostly due to serious inconsistency in definitions and measurement
   approaches across studies.Conclusions This systematic review
   demonstrated consistent increased odds of missed AMI/ACS diagnosis among
   black patients presenting to the ED compared with white patients in most
   studies. No consistent associations between demographic groups and DE
   related to cerebrovascular/neurological diagnoses were identified. More
   standardised approaches to study design, measurement of DE and outcomes
   assessment are needed to understand this problem among vulnerable
   populations.},

Title = {Mental health is related to metabolic syndrome: The Hispanic community
   health study/ study of Latinos},
Journal = {PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objective: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with common mental
   health conditions. Using cross-sectional data from the observational
   Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), this
   study examined the relationship between MetS and depression and anxiety
   in addition to testing moderating effects of gender and Hispanic
   heritage subgroups.Methods: Participants included 13,496 Hispanic
   Americans aged 18-74 (59\% women, mean age 46.59 +/- 13.65) from seven
   heritage subgroups. Depression was measured using the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression 10-item scale, and anxiety was assessed
   using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory 10-item scale. A 3-level
   categorical variable was developed to assess the combined influence of
   depression and anxiety. The dependent variable is dichotomous,
   delineating the presence or absence of MetS as defined by the National
   Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel. Logistic
   regression and Hayes' PROCESS macro assessed these relationships and the
   moderating effects of gender-heritage subgroups.Results: Results suggest
   depression (p < .001) and anxiety (p < .001) were associated with an
   increased likelihood of MetS. Puerto Ricans had the highest, and South
   Americans had the lowest, levels of depression and anxiety. Gender
   moderated the relationship between mental health and MetS, with women
   having a significant increase in the probability of MetS with depression
   (p < .001), anxiety (p < .001), or both (p < .001).Conclusion: Elevated
   symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with the presence of
   MetS in US Hispanic subgroups. Gender-heritage differences are present
   among the study variables. Strategies to manage psychological well-being
   must be employed to optimize cardiometabolic health in US Hispanics.},

Title = {Effect of Alteplase on Ischemic Stroke Mortality Is Dependent on Stroke

Abstract = {Objective: Although intravenous alteplase (IV-tPA) has a beneficial
   effect on functional outcome after ischemic stroke (IS), prior studies
   of IV-tPA's impact on post-stroke mortality did not have sufficient
   representation of more severe stroke.Methods: We determined if the
   interaction between the baseline National Institutes of Health (NIH)
   Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and IV-tPA modified the risk of mortality after IS
   in two cohorts: (1) National Inpatient Sample 2016-2020, and (2) a
   harmonized cohort of IS patients from the NINDS IV-tPA, ALIAS part 2,
   SHINE, FAST-MAG, IMS-III, POINT, and DEFUSE 3 trials. We fit logistic
   regression models to the outcome of in-hospital mortality (National
   Inpatient Sample {[}NIS] cohort) or mortality within 90 days (harmonized
   cohort), adjusted for baseline variables.Results: We included 198,668
   patients in the NIS cohort, of which 14.0\% received IV-tPA and 3.4\%
   died in hospital. We included 7,138 patients in the harmonized cohort,
   of which 33.2\% received IV-tPA and 9.4\% died by 90 days. Mortality in
   the NIS cohort was associated with older age, female sex, non-Hispanic
   white race, atrial fibrillation, and higher NIHSS. In the harmonized
   cohort, mortality was associated with older age, diabetes, atrial
   fibrillation, and higher NIHSS. In both cohorts, the interaction between
   NIHSS and IV-tPA was significant. In the NIS cohort, the separation
   became significant at NIHSS 15 and in the harmonized cohort at NIHSS 23,
   at which point, IV-tPA began to have a significant benefit for both
   in-hospital and 90-day mortality, respectively.Interpretation: IV-tPA is
   associated with a reduction in both in-hospital and 90-day mortality for
   patients with more severe IS. ANN NEUROL 2023},

Title = {Area-level socioeconomic status is positively correlated with
   glioblastoma incidence and prognosis in the United States},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY},

Abstract = {In the United States, an individual's access to resources, insurance
   status, and wealth are critical social determinants that affect both the
   risk and outcomes of many diseases. One disease for which the
   correlation with socioeconomic status (SES) is less well-characterized
   is glioblastoma (GBM), a devastating brain malignancy. The aim of this
   study was to review the current literature characterizing the
   relationship between area-level SES and both GBM incidence and prognosis
   in the United States. A query of multiple databases was performed to
   identify the existing data on SES and GBM incidence or prognosis. Papers
   were filtered by relevant terms and topics. A narrative review was then
   constructed to summarize the current body of knowledge on this topic. We
   obtained a total of three papers that analyze SES and GBM incidence,
   which all report a positive correlation between area-level SES and GBM
   incidence. In addition, we found 14 papers that focus on SES and GBM
   prognosis, either overall survival or GBM-specific survival. Those
   studies that analyze data from greater than 1,530 patients report a
   positive correlation between area-level SES and individual prognosis,
   while those with smaller study populations report no significant
   relationship. Our report underlines the strong association between SES
   and GBM incidence and highlights the need for large study populations to
   assess SES and GBM prognosis to ideally guide interventions that improve
   outcomes. Further studies are needed to determine underlying
   socio-economic stresses on GBM risk and outcomes to identify
   opportunities for intervention.},

Abstract = {Hispanic/Latino adults are a growing segment of the older U.S.
   population yet are underrepresented in brain aging research. We aimed to
   characterize brain aging among diverse Hispanic/Latino individuals.
   Hispanic/Latino individuals (unweighted n = 2273 ages 35-85 years; 56\%
   female) from the Hispanic Com-munity Health Study/Study of Latinos
   (HCHS/SOL) population-based study underwent magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) as part of the SOL-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging MRI
   (SOL-INCA-MRI) ancillary study (2018-2022). We performed linear
   regressions to calculate age associations with brain volumes for each
   outcome (total (global) brain, hippocampal, lateral ventricle, total
   white matter hyperintensity (WMH), individual cortical lobar, and total
   cortical gray matter) and tested modification by sex. Older age was
   associated with smaller gray matter volumes and larger lateral ventricle
   and WMH volumes. Age-related differences in global brain volumes and
   gray matter volumes in specific regions (i.e., the hip-pocampus and
   temporal and occipital lobes) were less pronounced among women. Our
   findings warrant further investigation into sex-specific mechanisms of
   brain aging using longitudinal studies.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published

Title = {Endovascular thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusion: translating

Abstract = {Background Basilar artery occlusion is a rare and severe condition. The
   effectiveness of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with basilar
   artery occlusion was unclear until recently, because these patients were
   excluded from most trials of endovascular thrombectomy for large-vessel
   occlusion ischaemic stroke.Recent developments The Basilar Artery
   International Cooperation Study (BASICS) and the Basilar Artery
   Occlusion Endovascular Intervention versus Standard Medical Treatment
   (BEST) trials, specifically designed to investigate the benefit of
   thrombectomy in patients with basilar artery occlusion, did not find
   significant evidence of a benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in terms
   of disability outcomes at 3 months after stroke. However, these trials
   suggested a potential benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in patients
   presenting with moderate-to-severe symptoms. Subsequently, the
   Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion (ATTENTION)
   and the Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular (BAOCHE) trials,
   which compared endovascular thrombectomy versus medical therapy within
   24 h of onset, showed clear benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in
   reducing disability and mortality, particularly in patients with
   moderate-to-severe symptoms. The risk of intracranial haemorrhage with
   endovascular thrombectomy was similar to the risk in anterior
   circulation stroke. Thrombectomy was beneficial regardless of age,
   baseline characteristics, the presence of intracranial atherosclerotic
   disease, and time from symptom onset to randomisation. Therefore, the
   question of whether endovascular thrombectomy is beneficial in basilar
   artery occlusion now appears to be settled in patients with
   moderate-to-severe symptoms, and endovascular thrombectomy should be
   offered to eligible patients.Where next? Key outstanding issues are the
   potential benefits of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with mild
   symptoms, the use of intravenous thrombolysis in an extended time window
   (ie, after 4 center dot 5 h of symptom onset), and the optimal
   endovascular technique for thrombectomy. Dedicated training programmes
   and automated software to assist with the assessment of imaging
   prognostic markers could be useful in the selection of patients who
   might benefit from endovascular thrombectomy. Large international
   research networks should be built to address knowledge gaps in this
   field and allow the conduct of clinical trials with fast and consecutive
   enrolment and a diverse ethnic representation.},

Abstract = {Objective:Hypertension is a critical cause of cardiovascular disease,
   and women with HIV have a higher prevalence of hypertension than women
   without HIV. The relationship between hypertension and mortality has not
   been well characterized in women with treated HIV. Here, we estimate the
   effect of hypertension on 1-year risk of all-cause mortality among women
   with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the United States.Design:An
   analysis of multicenter, observational cohort data from the Women's
   Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) collected between 1995 and 2019.Methods:We
   included women with HIV who reported ever using ART. We used parametric
   g-computation to estimate the effect of hypertension (SBP >= 140 mmHg,
   DBP >= 90 mmHg, or use of hypertensive medication) on all-cause
   mortality within 1 year of a WIHS visit.Results:Among 2929 unique women,
   we included 57 034 visits with a median age of 45 (interquartile range:
   39, 52) years. Women had hypertension at 34.5\% of visits, and 641
   deaths occurred within 1 year of a study visit. Comparing women at
   visits with hypertension to women at visits without hypertension, the
   standardized 1-year risk ratio for mortality was 1.16 {[}95\% confidence
   interval (95\% CI): 1.01-1.33]. The risk ratios were higher in Hispanic
   (risk ratio: 1.23, 95\% CI: 0.86-1.77) and non-Hispanic black women
   (risk ratio: 1.19, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.37) and lower in non-Hispanic white
   women (risk ratio: 0.93, 95\% CI: 0.58-1.48).Conclusion:Among women with
   treated HIV, those with hypertension, compared with those without, had
   an increased 1-year risk of all-cause mortality.},

Abstract = {PurposeThe objective of this study is to analyze characteristics of
   recurrent acute urinary retention (AUR) in patients with benign
   prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), utilizing a population based data set.
   Also, we sought to report on how AUR was treated, specifically regarding
   the need and length of catheterization and types of procedures utilized
   for mitigation. Materials \& MethodsA retrospective observational cohort
   study was performed using Optum's deidentified Clinformatics (R) Data
   Mart Database. We compared two groups, BPH patients with AUR (n =
   180,737) and BPH patients without AUR (n = 1,139,760) from January 1,
   2003 to December 31, 2017. Also, we analyzed the factors affecting the
   development of multiple episodes of AUR through age-adjusted
   multivariate analysis. ResultsIn contrast to the 47.7\% of patients who
   had a single AUR episode, 33.5\% of AUR patients developed 3 or more
   subsequent episodes of retention. For age matched patients, the risks of
   additional episodes of retention increase significantly with older age,
   Caucasian race, diabetes, neurologic conditions, or low income. Overall,
   the rate of BPH surgery in AUR patients over the study period decreased
   and the most common procedure was transurethral resection of the
   prostate. ConclusionsRisk factors for multiple episodes of AUR included
   age (60 and older), Caucasian race, lower income socioeconomic status,
   diabetes, and neurological disorders. Patients with a high probability
   of developing recurrent episodes of AUR are recommended to receive
   preemptive BPH medication before such AUR occurrences. Also, more
   expeditious surgical treatment should be considered rather than
   temporary catheterization when AUR occurs.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)
   in people with HIV are limited. Moreover, whether the associations
   between SDB and age or BMI differ by HIV status is unknown.RESEARCH
   QUESTION: Is SDB more prevalent in men with HIV than those without HIV,
   and do the predictors of SDB differ between the two groups?STUDY DESIGN
   AND METHODS: Home polysomnography was used in the Multicenter AIDS
   Cohort Study to assess SDB prevalence in men with (n = 466; 92\%
   virologically suppressed) and without (n = 370) HIV. SDB was defined
   using the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and the apnea-hypopnea index
   (AHI), using four definitions: >= 5 events/h based on an ODI with a 3\%
   (ODI3) or 4\% (ODI4) oxygen desaturation, or an AHI with a 3\% oxygen
   desaturation or EEG arousal (AHI3a) or with a 4\% oxygen desaturation
   (AHI4).RESULTS: SDB prevalence was similar in men with and without HIV
   using the ODI3 and AHI3a definitions. However, SDB prevalence was higher
   in men with than without HIV using the ODI4 (55.9\% vs 47.8\%; P = .04)
   and the AHI4 definitions (57.9\% vs 50.4\%; P = .06). Mild and moderate
   SDB were more common in men with than without HIV. Associations between
   SDB prevalence and age, race, and BMI were similar in men with and
   without HIV. Among men with HIV, viral load, CD4 cell count, and use of
   antiretroviral medications were not associated with SDB
   prevalence.INTERPRETATION: SDB prevalence was high overall but greater
   in men with than without HIV using the ODI4 threshold definition.
   Efforts to diagnose SDB are warranted in people with HIV, given that SDB
   is associated with daytime sleepiness and impaired quality of life.CHEST

Title = {Assessing cognitive impairment in an ethnically diverse cohort of
   oldest-old: the life after 90 study},
Journal = {AGING CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 4},
Abstract = {BackgroundThough dementia rates vary by racial or ethnic groups, it is
   unknown if these disparities remain among those aged 90 or older.AimsTo
   test this hypothesis, we used baseline clinical evaluation of 541
   ethnically and racially diverse individuals participating in the
   LifeAfter90 Study to assess how associations between core demographic
   characteristics and measures of physical and cognitive performance
   differ across the racial/ethnic groups.MethodsParticipants in this study
   were long-term non-demented members of Kaiser Permanente Northern
   California. They were clinically evaluated and diagnosed with normal or
   impaired cognition (mild cognitive impairment and dementia) through an
   in-person comprehensive clinical assessment consisting of a detailed
   medical history, physical and neurological examination, functional, and
   cognitive tests.ResultsThe average age at enrollment was 93.0 +/- 2.6
   years, 62.4\% female and 34.2\% non-Hispanic White. At initial
   evaluation 301 participants had normal cognition and 165 had mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) and despite screening, 69 participants were
   determined to have dementia. Age, education, 3MS, FAQ and CDR scores
   were significantly associated with cognitive impairment (normal versus
   MCI and dementia), but not gender. There was a significant univariate
   association between race/ethnicity and cognitive impairment (p < 0.02)
   being highest among Black (57.4\%) and lowest among Asian (32.7\%)
   individuals. After adjustment for age, gender, and education, however,
   prevalence of cognitive impairment was not influenced by race or
   ethnicity.ConclusionOur results confirm the ability to reliably assess
   clinical diagnosis in a diverse sample of very old individuals.},

Title = {COVID-19 vaccination willingness and uptake among rural Black/African
   American, Latino, and White adults},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 2},
Abstract = {PurposeThe purpose of this study was to assess differences in COVID-19
   vaccine willingness and uptake between rural and nonrural adults, and
   within rural racial-ethnic groups. MethodsWe utilized data from the
   COVID-19's Unequal Racial Burden online survey, which included 1,500
   Black/African American, Latino, and White rural adults (n = 500 each).
   Baseline (12/2020-2/2021) and 6-month follow-up (8/2021-9/2021) surveys
   were administered. A cohort of nonrural Black/African American, Latino,
   and White adults (n = 2,277) was created to compare differences between
   rural and nonrural communities. Multinomial logistic regression was used
   to assess associations between rurality, race-ethnicity, and vaccine
   willingness and uptake. FindingsAt baseline, only 24.9\% of rural adults
   were extremely willing to be vaccinated and 28.4\% were not at all
   willing. Rural White adults were least willing to be vaccinated,
   compared to nonrural White adults (extremely willing: aOR = 0.44, 95\%
   CI = 0.30-0.64). At follow-up, 69.3\% of rural adults were vaccinated;
   however, only 25.3\% of rural adults who reported being unwilling to
   vaccinate were vaccinated at follow-up, compared to 95.6\% of adults who
   were extremely willing to be vaccinated and 76.3\% who were unsure.
   Among those unwilling to vaccinate at follow-up, almost half reported
   distrust in the government (52.3\%) and drug companies (46.2\%); 80\%
   reported that nothing would change their minds regarding vaccination.
   ConclusionsBy August 2021, almost 70\% of rural adults were vaccinated.
   However, distrust and misinformation were prevalent among those
   unwilling to vaccinate at follow-up. To continue to effectively combat
   COVID-19 in rural communities, we need to address misinformation to
   increase COVID-19 vaccination rates.},

Abstract = {Background: The study aimed to analyze the 5-year survival of adult
   patients with glial tumors and to define characteristics that are
   associated with the disease outcomes in Kazakhstan. Methods: Medical
   records of patients that were surgically treated at the National Center
   for Neurosurgery during the 5-year period from 2016 to 2020 were
   collected retrospectively. Patients with a histologically confirmed
   diagnosis of diffuse astrocytic or oligodendroglial tumor type were
   included and their survival was assessed with life tables, Kaplan-Meier
   plot, and Cox regression using STATA 16 statistical software. Results:
   Almost half of the patients had glioblastoma. The 5-year survival rate
   of the whole sample was 45.93\%. Among Grade 4 patients, 15.6\% survived
   the 5-year mark. Differences in survival between grades 1-3 were not
   significant. Grade 1 patients demonstrated worse survival rates compared
   to Grade 2 patients (69\% vs. 74\%). Worse survival rates were observed
   among patients of Russian ethnicity and in rural residents. Conclusions:
   The study described the unusual patterns in survival rates of glial
   tumor patients in Kazakhstan, pointing to the need for reassessment of
   diagnostic accuracy and resulting treatment of glial patients in
   Kazakhstan, and the need to introduce molecular and genetic parameters
   in tumor type classification. Moreover, the observed difference in
   survival of different ethnic groups and residents of rural and urban
   areas should be further investigated and addressed by healthcare
   professionals.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To examine the prevalence and correlates of economic
   hardship and psychosocial distress experienced during the initial phase
   of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in a large cohort of
   Hispanic/Latino adults.Methods: The Hispanic Community Health
   Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), an ongoing multicenter study of
   Hispanic/Latino adults, collected information about COVID-19 illness and
   psychosocial and economic distress that occurred during the pandemic
   (N=11,283). We estimated the prevalence of these experiences during the
   initial phase of the pandemic (May 2020 to May 2021) and examined the
   prepandemic factors associated with pandemic-related economic hardship
   and emotional distress using multivariable log linear models with
   binomial distributions to estimate prevalence ratios.Results: Almost
   half of the households reported job losses and a third reported economic
   hardship during the first year of the pandemic. Pandemic-related
   household job losses and economic hardship were more pronounced among
   noncitizens who are likely to be undocumented. Pandemic-related economic
   hardship and psychosocial distress varied by age group and sex. Contrary
   to the economic hardship findings, noncitizens were less likely to
   report pandemic-related psychosocial distress. Prepandemic social
   resources were inversely related to psychosocial distress.Conclusions:
   The study findings underscore the economic vulnerability that the
   pandemic has brought to ethnic minoritized and immigrant populations in
   the United States, in particular noncitizens. The study also highlights
   the need to incorporate documentation status as a social determinant of
   health. Characterizing the initial economic and mental health impact of
   the pandemic is important for understanding the pandemic consequences on
   future health. Clinical Trial Registration Number: NCT02060344},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND:As the opioid epidemic accelerates in the United States,
   numerous sociodemographic factors have been implicated its development
   and are, furthermore, a driving factor of the disparities in
   postoperative pain management. Recent studies have suggested potential
   associations between the influence of race and ethnicity on pain
   perception but also the presence of unconscious biases in the treatment
   of pain in minority patients.OBJECTIVE:To characterize the perioperative
   opioid requirements across racial groups after spine surgery.METHODS:A
   retrospective, observational study of 1944 opioid-naive adult patients
   undergoing a neurosurgical spine procedure, from June 2012 to December
   2019, was performed at a large, quaternary care institute. Postoperative
   inpatient and outpatient opioid usage was measured by oral morphine
   equivalents, across various racial groups.RESULTS:Case characteristics
   were similar between racial groups. In the postoperative period, White
   patients had shorter lengths of stay compared with Black and Asian
   patients (P < .05). Asian patients used lower postoperative inpatient
   opioid doses in comparison with White patients (P < .001). White
   patients were discharged with significantly higher doses of opioids
   compared with Black patients (P < .01); however, they were less likely
   to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge (P < .01).CONCLUSION:In a
   large cohort of opioid-naive postoperative neurosurgical patients, this
   study demonstrates higher inpatient and outpatient postoperative opioid
   usage among White patients. Increasing physician awareness to the effect
   of race on inpatient and outpatient pain management would allow for a
   modified opioid prescribing practice that ensures limited yet effective
   opioid dosages void of implicit biases.},

Abstract = {Aims: To determine whether out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
   post-resuscitation management and outcomes differ between four Detroit
   hospitals.Introduction: Significant variation exists in
   treatment/outcomes from OHCA. Disparities between hospitals serving a
   similar population is not well known.Methods: Retrospective OHCA data
   was collected from the Detroit-Cardiac Arrest Registry (DCAR) between
   January 2014 to December 2019. Four hospitals were compared on two
   treatments (angiography, do not resuscitate (DNR)) and two outcomes
   (cerebral performance category (CPC) < 2, in-hospital death). Models for
   death and CPC were tested with and without coronary angiography and DNR
   status.Results: 999 patients at hospitals A -D differed (p < 0.05)
   before multivariable adjustment by age, race, witnessed arrest,
   dispatch-emergency department (ED) time, TTM, coronary angiography, DNR
   order, and in-hospital death. Rates of death and CPC < 2 were worse in
   Hospital A (82.8\%, 10\%, respectively) compared to others (69.1\%,
   14.1\%). After multivariable adjustment, Hospital A performed
   angiography less compared to B (OR = 0.17) and was more likely to
   initiate new DNR status than B (OR = 2.9), C (OR = 16.1), or D (OR =
   3.6). CPC < 2 were worse in Hospital A compared to B (OR = 0.27) and D
   (OR = 0.35). After sensitivity analysis, CPC < 2 odds did not differ for
   A versus B (OR = 0.58, adjusted for angiog-raphy) or D (OR = 0.65,
   adjusted for DNR). Odds of death, despite angiography and DNR
   differences, were worse in Hospital A compared to B (OR = 1.87) and D
   (OR = 1.81).Conclusion: Differing rates of DNR and coronary angiography
   was associated with observed disparities in favorable neurologic
   outcome, but not death, between four Detroit hospitals.},

Title = {Relationship Between Neighborhood Disadvantage and Mild Traumatic Brain
   Injury Symptoms},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEAD TRAUMA REHABILITATION},

Abstract = {Objective:To test the hypotheses that (1) higher neighborhood
   disadvantage is associated with greater injury-related symptom severity
   in civilians with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and (2)
   neighborhood disadvantage remains predictive after controlling for other
   established predictors. Setting:Level 1 trauma center and affiliated
   academic medical center. Participants:N = 171 individuals with mTBI.
   Design:Prospective cohort study. Main Measures:Rivermead Post Concussion
   Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) total score assessed less than 24 hours and
   at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months postinjury. Linear mixed-effects
   models were used to assess the relationship between predictor variables
   and mTBI-related symptom burden (RPQ score). Neighborhood disadvantage
   was quantified by the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a composite of 17
   markers of socioeconomic position (SEP) scored at the census block group
   level. Results:Individuals in the upper ADI quartile of the national
   distribution displayed higher RPQ symptoms than those in the lower 3
   quartiles (P < .001), with a nonsignificant ADI x visit interaction (P =
   .903). In a multivariable model, the effect of ADI remained significant
   (P = .034) after adjusting for demographics, individual SEP, and injury
   factors. Other unique predictors in the multivariable model were gender
   (gender x visit P = .035), health insurance type (P = .017), and
   injury-related litigation (P = .012). Conclusion:Neighborhood
   disadvantage as quantified by the ADI is robustly associated with
   greater mTBI-related symptom burden throughout the first 6 months
   postinjury. That the effect of ADI remained after controlling for
   demographics, individual SEP, and injury characteristics implies that
   neighborhood disadvantage is an important, understudied factor
   contributing to clinical recovery from mTBI.},

Title = {Disparities in Adherence to Concussion Clinical Care Recommendations in
   a Pediatric Population},

Abstract = {Objective:To characterize the relationship of sociodemographic factors
   to adherence to provider recommendations for pediatric concussion.
   Setting:Primary care (PC) practices within the Children's Hospital of
   Philadelphia network. Participants:Patients aged 5 to 18 years old who
   presented to any PC site for concussion from September 26, 2019, to
   December 31, 2019. Design:Retrospective medical record review. Main
   measures:The primary outcome was adherence to follow-up recommendations
   as defined by (1) continued follow-up until provider clearance to return
   to full activity; (2) no more than 2 no-show visits; and (3) for those
   referred to specialty care (SC), attending at least 1 visit. We compared
   adherence by race/ethnicity, insurance, age, sex, injury mechanism, and
   repeat head injury using bivariate and multivariate analyses. A
   secondary outcome of referral to SC was compared by sociodemographic
   factors. Results:A total of 755 patients were included. Overall, 80.5\%
   of the patients met adherence criteria. Following adjustment,
   non-Hispanic Black patients and publicly insured/self-pay patients were
   less likely to adhere to recommendations than non-Hispanic White
   patients (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] = 0.60; 95\% CI, 0.37-1.00) and
   privately insured patients (AOR = 0.48; 95\% CI, 0.30-0.75),
   respectively. When assessing differences in referral to SC, non-Hispanic
   Black patients and publicly insured/self-pay patients were more likely
   to receive a referral than their non-Hispanic White peers (OR = 1.56;
   95\% CI, 1.00-2.45) and privately insured patients (OR = 1.56; 95\% CI,
   1.05-2.32), respectively. Conclusion:This study highlights disparities
   in adherence to concussion care recommendations, with non-Hispanic Black
   and publicly insured/self-pay patients less likely to adhere to
   follow-up recommendations than non-Hispanic White and privately insured
   patients, respectively. These disparities may impact recovery
   trajectories. Future studies should aim to identify specific individual-
   and system-level barriers preventing adherence to care in order to
   ultimately inform targeted interventions to achieve equity in care
   delivery and outcomes.},

Abstract = {IntroductionInequitable access to leisure-time physical activity (LTPA)
   resources may explain geographic disparities in type 2 diabetes (T2D).
   We evaluated whether the neighborhood socioeconomic environment (NSEE)
   affects T2D through the LTPA environment.Research design and methodsWe
   conducted analyses in three study samples: the national Veterans
   Administration Diabetes Risk (VADR) cohort comprising electronic health
   records (EHR) of 4.1 million T2D-free veterans, the national prospective
   cohort REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS)
   (11 208 T2D free), and a case-control study of Geisinger EHR in
   Pennsylvania (15 888 T2D cases). New-onset T2D was defined using
   diagnoses, laboratory and medication data. We harmonized
   neighborhood-level variables, including exposure, confounders, and
   effect modifiers. We measured NSEE with a summary index of six census
   tract indicators. The LTPA environment was measured by physical activity
   (PA) facility (gyms and other commercial facilities) density within
   street network buffers and population-weighted distance to parks. We
   estimated natural direct and indirect effects for each mediator
   stratified by community type.ResultsThe magnitudes of the indirect
   effects were generally small, and the direction of the indirect effects
   differed by community type and study sample. The most consistent
   findings were for mediation via PA facility density in rural
   communities, where we observed positive indirect effects (differences in
   T2D incidence rates (95\% CI) comparing the highest versus lowest
   quartiles of NSEE, multiplied by 100) of 1.53 (0.25, 3.05) in REGARDS
   and 0.0066 (0.0038, 0.0099) in VADR. No mediation was evident in
   Geisinger.ConclusionsPA facility density and distance to parks did not
   substantially mediate the relation between NSEE and T2D. Our
   heterogeneous results suggest that approaches to reduce T2D through
   changes to the LTPA environment require local tailoring.},

Abstract = {To evaluate the management of rare movement disorders (RMD) at the
   international level and identify care needs to be addressed, the Rare
   Movement Disorders Study Group of the International Parkinson and
   Movement Disorders Society (MDS) has conducted an exploratory survey. We
   sent an online survey to experts in Africa, Asia, Oceania and American
   continents following the classification of the MDS Regional Sections:
   Africa, Asia and Oceania (A\&O), and Pan-America. We did not include
   Europe as the European Reference Network for Rare Neurological Diseases
   recently performed a similar care needs survey across European
   countries. We obtained responses from experts from 20 African, 26 A\&O
   and 19 Pan-American countries. According to the respondents, only 55\%
   of African countries had movement disorders experts, while these were
   present in 96\% of A\&O and 91\% of Pan-American. Access to care for
   patients with RMD was stated difficult in 70\% of African, 54\% of A\&O,
   and 65\% of Pan-American countries. Africa was the region with greatest
   difficulties in accessing diagnostic tests. However, in Pan-America and
   A\&O, large inequalities were observed between countries with quite
   variable access to therapeutic options such as deep brain stimulation.
   The survey results reflect wide variability in the management of RMD and
   provide evidence that a worldwide care-focused network is highly
   warranted. Scientific and medical organisations should raise awareness
   of deficits in managing RMD and care disparities among regions. The
   goals should be to facilitate the training of professionals, establish
   improvement strategies, and increase support and budgeting for these
   diseases.},

Title = {Factors Affecting the Choice of Neurosurgery Subspecialty: A Geographic
   and Gender-Wise Analysis},
Journal = {WORLD NEUROSURGERY},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand the factors that affect decision-making when
   choosing a specific subspecialty while exploring gender and geographic
   variables.METHODS: A cross-sectional, 13-item, nonrandomized online
   survey was created and shared over various social media platforms of the
   Neurosurgery Cocktail. Data were collected between January and April
   2022. The survey focused on the amount of exposure to subspecialties
   dur-ing training, along with factors affecting the decision in choosing
   a specific subspecialty.RESULTS: A total of 207 respondents,
   predominantly from Asian and European countries, with an 83.6\%
   dominance of male respondents, completed the survey. The most common
   subspecialties with maximum exposure were neurosur-gical oncology,
   spine, and neurocritical care and trauma, whereas peripheral nerve
   surgery and stereotactic and functional neurosurgery were the least
   exposed. In total, 70\% of the respondents had no training or degree in
   a subspecialty, which was the greatest in Asian and African countries (P
   = 0.0205). Respondents found the prestige and lifestyle of a skull base
   neurosurgeon very attractive (P = 0.027, 0.034 respectively), whereas
   the lifestyle and salary of spine neurosurgeons made it a popular
   subspe-cialty (P < 0.001, 0.008, respectively). Personal interest in
   neurosurgical oncology established its popularity among the respondents
   (P = 0.028).CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic and functional neurosur-gery and
   peripheral nerve surgery are the emerging subspecialties and hence their
   exposure and access are highly limited to the developed world whereas
   spine and neurosurgical oncology branches had a homogenous geographic
   presence. Pediatric neurosurgery had the most female representation,
   thereby necessitating the need to uplift women in other subspecialties.},

Title = {Racial disparities in readmission rates following surgical treatment of
   pediatric developmental dysplasia of the hip},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY},

Abstract = {PurposeAcross orthopedic subspecialties, significant racial disparities
   have been identified with regard to postoperative outcomes. Despite
   these findings among adult patients, the literature assessing these
   disparities within pediatric orthopedics is limited. The purpose of this
   study was to determine the independent predictors for unplanned
   readmission following surgical treatment of developmental dysplasia of
   the hip.MethodsPediatric patients undergoing hip dysplasia surgery from
   2012 to 2019 were identified in the National Surgical Quality
   Improvement Program-Pediatric database. Two patient groups were defined:
   patients who had unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of
   surgery and patients who were not readmitted. Clinical characteristics
   assessed included gender, race, and American Society of
   Anesthesiologists (ASA) class. Risk factors for complications were
   assessed using bivariate and multivariate analysis.ResultsOf 6561
   pediatric patients undergoing surgical treatment for hip dysplasia, 540
   (8.2\%) had unplanned readmission. On bivariate analysis, non-white race
   (Black, Asian, Hispanic, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian), an ASA
   class of III, IV, or V, pulmonary, renal, neurological, and
   gastrointestinal comorbidities, as well as immune disease, steroid use,
   and nutritional support were significantly associated with unplanned
   readmission (p < 0.05 for all). After controlling for confounding
   variables on multivariate analysis, non-white race (OR 1.46; p = 0.042)
   and ASA class of III-V (OR 2.21; p = 0.002) were found to be independent
   predictors for readmission.ConclusionClinicians should be advised of the
   increased readmission rates observed in non-white patients and those of
   higher ASA scores. Further work is needed to combat existing disparities
   within pediatric orthopedics.},

Title = {Coding long COVID: characterizing a new disease through an ICD-10 lens},
Journal = {BMC MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 16},
Abstract = {Background Naming a newly discovered disease is a difficult process; in
   the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existence of post-acute
   sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), which includes long COVID, it
   has proven especially challenging. Disease definitions and assignment of
   a diagnosis code are often asynchronous and iterative. The clinical
   definition and our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of long
   COVID are still in flux, and the deployment of an ICD-10-CM code for
   long COVID in the USA took nearly 2 years after patients had begun to
   describe their condition. Here, we leverage the largest publicly
   available HIPAA-limited dataset about patients with COVID-19 in the US
   to examine the heterogeneity of adoption and use of U09.9, the ICD-10-CM
   code for ``Post COVID-19 condition, unspecified.{''}
   Methods We undertook a number of analyses to characterize the N3C
   population with a U09.9 diagnosis code (n = 33,782), including assessing
   person-level demographics and a number of area-level social determinants
   of health; diagnoses commonly co-occurring with U09.9, clustered using
   the Louvain algorithm; and quantifying medications and procedures
   recorded within 60 days of U09.9 diagnosis. We stratified all analyses
   by age group in order to discern differing patterns of care across the
   lifespan.
   Results We established the diagnoses most commonly co-occurring with
   U09.9 and algorithmically clustered them into four major categories:
   cardiopulmonary, neurological, gastrointestinal, and comorbid
   conditions. Importantly, we discovered that the population of patients
   diagnosed with U09.9 is demographically skewed toward female, White,
   non-Hispanic individuals, as well as individuals living in areas with
   low poverty and low unemployment. Our results also include a
   characterization of common procedures and medications associated with
   U09.9-coded patients.
   Conclusions This work offers insight into potential subtypes and current
   practice patterns around long COVID and speaks to the existence of
   disparities in the diagnosis of patients with long COVID. This latter
   finding in particular requires further research and urgent remediation.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesCurrent knowledge regarding the relationship between social
   determinants of health (SDOH) characteristics of hospitalized American
   pregnant women and fetal growth restriction (FGR) reveals a dearth in
   the literature. Therefore, we examined the impact of SDOH on FGR among
   hospitalized American women in this study.MethodsUsing the Nationwide
   Inpatient Sample (NIS) dataset for the years 2016-2018, we conducted
   this cross-sectional study. We conducted survey logistic regression to
   examine the association between SDOH factors and FGR, after adjusting
   for various hospitalization characteristics.ResultsNon-Hispanic
   (NH)-Black people had the highest prevalence of SDOH issues (0.7\%),
   followed by Hispanics who had a prevalence of 0.4\%. We observed that
   pregnant women with SDOH issues were 1.16 times as likely to experience
   FGR as those without SDOH (95\% CI 1.0-1.34). When compared to their
   respective racial counterparts without SDOH, Hispanics with SDOH had
   increased odds, NH-White and NH-others with SDOH had the same
   likelihood, and NH-Black women with SDOH had lower odds of
   FGR.Conclusions for PracticeOverall, our study illustrated an
   association between maternal SDOH issues and FGR, and the impact of SDOH
   issues on the outcome of FGR across various racial/ethnic groups. While
   our study provides useful insight into the topic, further research is
   needed to explain the observed varied influence of SDOH on FGR across
   racial/ethnic groups.
   SignificanceWhat is already known on this subject? Children with fetal
   growth restriction (FGR) present with a greater risk of long-term health
   effects including impaired neurological, cardiovascular and endocrine
   diseases in adulthood. FGR affects 5-10\% of pregnancies and is the
   second leading cause of perinatal mortality.What this study adds? An
   association between maternal social determinants of health (SDOH) issues
   and FGR, and the impact of SDOH issues on the outcome of FGR across
   various racial/ethnic groups is present. When compared to their
   respective racial counterparts without SDOH, Hispanics with SDOH had
   increased odds of FGR.},

Title = {Ethnodemographic characterization of stroke incidence and burden of
   disease in hospital discharge records in Ecuador},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {IntroductionStroke is the second most common cause of death and
   disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally. However, the incidence
   and impact of stroke by ethnicity and gender is frequently distinct.
   This is particularly the case in Ecuador where geographic and economic
   marginalization are often correlated with ethnic marginalization and the
   extent to which females lack the same opportunities as their male
   counterparts. The aim of this paper is to investigate the differential
   impacts in terms of stroke diagnosis and burden of disease by ethnicity
   and gender, using hospital discharge records over the years 2015-2020.
   MethodsThis paper calculates stroke incidence, and fatality rates using
   hospital discharge and death records over the years 2015-2020. The DALY
   package in R was employed to calculate the Disability Adjusted Life
   Years lost due to stroke in Ecuador. ResultsThe results show that while
   the incidence rate of stroke in males (64.96 per 100,000 persons-year)
   is higher than that for females on average (57.84 per 100,000
   persons-year), males accounted for 52.41\% of all stroke cases and 53\%
   of all surviving cases. Thus, hospital data suggests that females had a
   higher death rate when compared to males. Case fatality rates also
   differed significantly by ethnicity. The highest fatality rate
   corresponded to the Montubio ethnic group (87.65\%), followed by
   Afrodescendants (67.21\%). The estimated burden of disease of stroke
   calculated using Ecuadorian hospital records (2015-2020) varied from
   1,468 to 2,991 DALY per 1,000 population on average.
   DiscussionDifferences in the burden of disease by ethnic group are
   likely to reflect differential access to care by region and
   socio-economic group, both of which are frequently correlated with
   ethnic composition in Ecuador. Equitable access to health services
   remains an important challenge in the country. The gender discrepancy in
   fatality rates suggests that there is a need for targeted educational
   campaigns to identify stroke signs early, especially in the female
   population.},

Title = {Our pride, our joy: An intersectional constructivist grounded theory
   analysis of resources that promote resilience in SGM communities},

Abstract = {IntroductionSexual and gender minority (SGM) communities, including
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual, and
   Two-Spirit people, have historically been researched from a
   deficits-based approach that fails to highlight the ways communities
   survive and thrive in the face of adversity. This study endeavored to
   create a model of resources that promote SGM resilience using a sample
   that amplified traditionally underrepresented perspectives, including
   individuals from racial and/or ethnic minority groups, trans and/or
   gender diverse individuals, individuals on the asexual spectrum, and
   older adults. MethodsParticipant responses to three open-ended questions
   from The PRIDE Study's (an online national longitudinal cohort study of
   SGM people) 2018 Annual Questionnaire were analyzed using constructivist
   grounded theory. These questions examined what brings people joy and
   what they appreciate most about their SGM identity. Participants (n =
   315) were randomly selected from a larger sample of people who had
   responded to demographic questions and at least one open-ended question
   (N = 4,030) in a manner to ensure diverse representation across
   race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, and region of
   residence. ResultsThe proposed model includes social resources
   (Connecting with Others, Cultivating Family, Helping Others,
   Participating in Culture and Spirituality), affective generative
   resources (Engaging in Enriching Pursuits, Accessing Economic
   Resources), and introspective resources (Exploring One's Authentic Self,
   Persevering through Hardship) that are theorized to contribute to SGM
   resilience across the life course. ConclusionsSGM communities may tap
   into various resources to promote resilience. As public health
   practitioners, we can help to foster this resilience by resourcing and
   supporting initiatives that foster social connection, create spaces for
   community members to engage with various types of enrichment, facilitate
   access to economic resources, and provide support and inclusion for all
   SGM community members.},

Title = {Cultural and neighborhood characteristics associated with
   activity-specific parenting practices in Hispanic/Latino youth: a
   secondary analysis of the Hispanic Community Children's health
   study/study of Latino youth},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},

Abstract = {Hispanic/Latino youth are less physically active than
   non-Hispanic/Latino youth. We assessed whether activity-specific
   parenting practices relate to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
   (MVPA) and sedentary behavior among Hispanic/Latino youth, and whether
   cultural (acculturation) and neighborhood characteristics (perceived
   barriers to activity) relate to the use of parenting practice patterns.
   Using the Hispanic Community Children's Health Study/Study of Latino
   Youth (SOL Youth, n=976 8-16-year-olds), we modeled linear regression
   associations between parenting practices and mean daily MVPA and
   sedentary behavior. Parenting practice patterns were then developed
   using k-means cluster analysis, and regressed on parental acculturation
   and neighborhood characteristics. Discipline predicted higher MVPA in
   females (beta 1.89 {[}95\% CI 0.11-3.67]), while
   Monitoring/Reinforcement predicted higher MVPA in males (beta 4.71
   {[}95\% CI 0.68-8.74]). Three patterns were then identified: Negative
   Reinforcement (high Limit Setting and Discipline use), Positive
   Reinforcement (high Limit Setting and Monitoring/Reinforcement use), and
   Permissive Parenting (low parenting practice use). Higher acculturation
   predicted use of Positive Reinforcement. Activity-specific parenting
   practices are associated with activity in sex-specific ways among
   Hispanic/Latino youth, and cultural factors predict the use of parenting
   practices.},

Abstract = {Background and ObjectivesBeing on a newer, second-, and third-generation
   antiseizure medication (ASM) may represent an important marker of
   quality of care for people with epilepsy. We sought to examine whether
   there were racial/ethnic differences in their use.MethodsUsing Medicaid
   claims data, we identified the type and number of ASMs, as well as the
   adherence, for people with epilepsy over a 5-year period (2010-2014). We
   used multilevel logistic regression models to examine the association
   between newer-generation ASMs and adherence. We then examined whether
   there were racial/ethnic differences in ASM use in models adjusted for
   demographics, utilization, year, and comorbidities.ResultsAmong 78,534
   adults with epilepsy, 17,729 were Black, and 9,376 were Hispanic.
   Overall, 25.6\% were on older ASMs, and being solely on
   second-generation ASMs during the study period was associated with
   better adherence (adjusted odds ratio: 1.17, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 1.11-1.23). Those who saw a neurologist (3.26, 95\% CI:
   3.13-3.41) or who were newly diagnosed (1.29, 95\% CI: 1.16-1.42) had
   higher odds of being on newer ASMs. Importantly, Black (0.71, 95\% CI:
   0.68-0.75), Hispanic (0.93, 95\% CI: 0.88-0.99), and Native Hawaiian and
   Other Pacific Island individuals (0.77, 95\% CI: 0.67-0.88) had lower
   odds of being on newer ASMs when compared with White
   individuals.DiscussionGenerally, racial and ethnic minoritized people
   with epilepsy have lower odds of being on newer-generation ASMs. Greater
   adherence by people who were only on newer ASMs, their greater use among
   people seeing a neurologist, and the opportunity of a new diagnosis
   point to actionable leverage points for reducing inequities in epilepsy
   care.},

Title = {Risk factors and predictors of intracranial hemorrhage after mechanical

Abstract = {BackgroundReducing intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) can improve patient
   outcome in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) intervention. We sought to
   identify ICH risk factors after AIS thrombectomy. MethodsThis is a
   retrospective review of the Stroke Thrombectomy and Aneurysm Registry
   (STAR) database. All patients who underwent AIS thrombectomy with
   available ICH data were included. Multivariable regression models were
   developed to identify predictors of ICH after thrombectomy. Subgroup
   analyses were performed stratified by symptom status and European
   Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) grade. ResultsThe study cohort
   comprised 6860 patients. Any ICH and symptomatic ICH (sICH) occurred in
   25\% and 7\% of patients, respectively. Hemorrhagic infarction 1 (HI1)
   occurred in 36\%, HI2 in 24\%, parenchymal hemorrhage 1 (PH1) in 22\%,
   and PH2 in 17\% of patients classified by ECASS grade. Intraprocedural
   complications independently predicted any ICH (OR 3.8083, P<0.0001), PH1
   (OR 1.9053, P=0.0195), and PH2 (OR 2.7347, P=0.0004). Race also
   independently predicted any ICH (black: OR 0.5180, P=0.0017; Hispanic:
   OR 0.4615, P=0.0148), sICH (non-white: OR 0.4349, P=0.0107), PH1
   (non-white: OR 3.1668, P<0.0001), and PH2 (non-white: OR 1.8689,
   P=0.0176), with white as the reference. Primary mechanical thrombectomy
   technique also independently predicted ICH. ADAPT (A Direct Aspiration
   First Pass Technique) was a negative predictor of sICH (OR 0.2501,
   P<0.0001), with stent retriever as the reference. ConclusionsThis study
   identified ICH risk factors after AIS thrombectomy using real-world
   data. There was a propensity towards a reduced sICH risk with direct
   aspiration. Procedural complications and ethnicity were predictors
   congruent between categories of any ICH, sICH, PH1, and PH2. Further
   investigation of technique and ethnicity effects on ICH and outcomes
   after AIS thrombectomy is warranted.},

Abstract = {Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is a common disease associated with
   increased risk for cardiometabolic, cardiovascular, and cognitive
   diseases. How SDB affects the molecular environment is still poorly
   understood. We study the association of three SDB measures with gene
   expression measured using RNA-seq in multiple blood tissues from the
   Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We develop genetic instrumental
   variables for the associated transcripts as polygenic risk scores
   (tPRS), then generalize and validate the tPRS in the Women's Health
   Initiative. We measure the associations of the validated tPRS with SDB
   and serum metabolites in Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of
   Latinos. Here we find differential gene expression by blood cell type in
   relation to SDB traits and link P2XR4 expression to average
   oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep and butyrylcarnitine (C4) levels.
   These findings can be used to develop interventions to alleviate the
   effect of SDB on the human molecular environment.},

Abstract = {Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is used to evaluate kidney
   function and determine the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), a
   highly prevalent disease in the US1-3 that varies among subgroups of
   Hispanic/Latino individuals.4,5 The polygenic risk score (PRS) is a
   popular method that uses large genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
   to provide a strong estimate of disease risk.7 How-ever, due to the
   limited availability of summary statistics from GWAS meta-analyses based
   on Hispanic/Latino populations, PRSs can only be computed using
   different ancestry GWASs. The performance of eGFR PRSs derived from
   other GWAS reference populations for Hispanic/Latino population has not
   been examined. We compared PRS constructions for eGFR prediction in
   Hispanic/Latino in-dividuals using GWAS-significant variants, clumping
   and thresholding (C\&T),8 and PRS-CS,22 as well as a combination of PRSs
   calcu-lated with different reference GWAS meta-analyses from European
   and multi-ethnic studies in Hispanic/Latino individuals from the
   Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). All eGFR
   PRSs were highly associated with eGFR (p < 1E-20). Additionally, eGFR
   PRSs were significantly associated with lower risk of prevalent CKD at
   visit 1 or 2 and incident CKD at visit 2, with the combined PRSs having
   the best performance. These PRS findings were replicated in an
   additional dataset of Hispanic/ Latino individuals using data from the
   Women's Health Initiative SNP Health Association Resource (WHI-SHARe).17},
